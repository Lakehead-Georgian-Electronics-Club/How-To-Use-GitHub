# Organization of the GitHub Page
- All project information will be held under the Repositories tab
- Each Project will have its own repository.
  - Additional folders within a repository will be used for all the relevant information/resources
  - Members are free to create their own repositories and edit existing ones. The only condition is that any changes are submitted as pull requests then approved by the admin of the repository. 
- Don't get confused by the projects tab within the repository.
-   the projects tab is for project management related information related to the project in the repository. For example, it can be used to organize and assign tasks to team members.

  - Let me know if there are any issues with uploading anything.
