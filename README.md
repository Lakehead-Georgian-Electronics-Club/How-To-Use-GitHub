# Organization of the GitHub Page
- All project information will be held under the Repositories tab
  - Additional folders within a repository will be used for all the relevant information/resources
  - Members are free to create their own repositories and edit existing ones. The only condition is that any changes are submitted as pull requests then approved by the admin of the repository. 

  - Let me know if there are any issues with uploading anything.
